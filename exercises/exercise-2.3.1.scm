;; Thoughts
;; In finding out the free variables of an expression, do you necessarily
;; need to know the bindings so far?
;; Not really, you only need to know the bindings of the immediate context to
;; determine if the free variables found so far are bound or not.
;; Proceeding in this manner in recursively removing the bound variables, one
;; can arrive at the list of free variables.
;; I can't help but think this is some kind of subtraction of indices happening,
;; if you think of these as De Bruijn indices.

;; My previous answer to this question was yes.
;; With my reasoning that the nested context in which an expression is embedded
;; determines whether a variable is free or not. Adding a lambda function
;; as a new context around a certain binding can have a change in meaning
;; for a variable even if it is deeply nested within other expressions.
;; For example in:
;; free-p = (位 (z) (位 (y) (位 (x) p)))
;; p is a free variable
;; But if we go to provide a context for it as
;; (位 (p) free-p), the p becomes bound to the formal parameter introduced.
;; By this reasoning, I thought this sensitivity to the context lead to
;; an algorithm that progressively keeps track of the bindings that have been
;; performed so far. This could be of use in certain other contexts, which I need
;; to characterize carefully, but to figure out whether a given variable is free or
;; not, one can proceed piecemeal by successively removing the bound variables through
;; a structural recursion.

;; I think, I again have to revise my answer now.
;; There is a case where a variable can be both bound or unbound ((lambda (x) x) x)
;; Here, the outer x is free while the inner x is bound.
;; Consider this carefully. I think this is where alpha renaming becomes significant.
