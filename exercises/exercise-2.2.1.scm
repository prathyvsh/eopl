;; In the case of nth-elt, it is important that a positive check for l is performed.
;; This can be done with the help of a guard for list? in the beginning of the procedure as:

(define (guarded-nth-elt l idx)
  (if (list? l)
      (nth-elt l idx)
      (error "Please provide a list")))

;; list-ref
(define (guarded-list-ref l n) (if (list? l) (list-ref l n) (error "Please provide a list")))
;; length
(define (length l) (if (list? l) (length l) (error "Please provied a list")))

;; Q. Can a sensible value be returned sometimes?
;; A. Yes, a sensible value can be returned in the case of certain operations.
;; A behaviour like this can be found in Javascript, when you try to find the
;; index of a non-existent character is provided, a -1 value is returned.
;; Similarly, a boolean false can be returned in the case of certain operations
;; when a search or operation fails.

;; When is it worth the effort to check that arguments are of the right type? Why?
;; In a dynamically typed language, it is worth checking the type in cases where a
;; function can be expected to be given an elaborate data structure, the parts of
;; which can sometimes violate the requisite type. Also, when thereâ€™s a communication
;; gap between between the producer of the library and the consumer, the library author
;; by understanding the use case of the consumer could also provide dynamic type checking
;; at critical junctures of the codebase.
