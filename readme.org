* Essentials of Programming Languages

* Section 1

** Syntax
Rules governing how a programming language is formed

** Semantics
Rules that specify its meaning

** Section 1.1: Simple Expressions
Introduces several ways of building Scheme expressions.

*** Statement
A programming language construct that is evaluated only for its side effect.
Eg: Assignment, I/O statements, control statements.

Expressions: Programming language constructs that are evaluated to obtain values.

Expressions that are evaluated solely for their value, and not for any computational effects are said to be functional

*** 1.1.1 Literals, Procedure Calls, and Variables

**** Literals
They always return the expressed value.
Eg: Numbers, Booleans, Strings

**** Variable References

A value can be bound to a variable. This is itâ€™s reference.

A variable is said to denote the value of its binding.

The data that can be bound to variables constitute the denoted values of a programming language.
